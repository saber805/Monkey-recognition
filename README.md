# Monkey-recognition(based on Pytorch)
The dataset can be found on Kaggle. Named 10 Monkey Species .
Using VGG16 backbone as feature extraction.Just change the MLP.
And training 80epoch and got 98% accuracy on Test set.It took a long time.
I'd love to share my training model, but it has 100M and I can't upload it.


练了80轮，vgg16特征提取，最后98%多的准确率。
训练集可以在kaggle上找到，或者这里：https://blog.csdn.net/qq_45882032/article/details/121749646
